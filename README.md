HOW TO USE: Open the project in VSCode, and click "Run and Debug." After the browser tab opens, go into the debug console and look around the section with white text until you find the URL with "http" instead of "https," which you can then copy and paste into an API platform such as Postman. After you paste it, you will need to edit the URL to add "/OddOrEven/odd/{number}" onto the end of it, but type the number you want to use instead of {number}. After entering that and hitting Enter, the API should display a message saying if the number you entered was even or odd.

Peer Review: N. HARRISON WILKINS : THE PROGRSM RUN AS EXPECTED. THE CPDE LOOKS NICE AND DOES FEATURE DATA VALIDATION,  OVERALL GREAT WORK!!!
